# MessageDumper

This bot will dump all messages in a channel where ```%dump``` is entered in.

I do not provide any hosting or support, so you will have to run this bot yourself. A Discord bot token will need to be passed as the first parameter on the command line. The bot needs to have the permission to send/read messages, upload files, and read message history.
